    "4. x: This mode is used to open a file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, a FileExistsError error will be raised.\n",

    "1. Resource Management: When a file is opened, it takes up system resources like memory and file descriptors. If the file is not closed properly, these resources will remain occupied, leading to resource leakage and potential performance issues. Closing the file releases these resources, making them available for other processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Data Integrity: When a file is written to, the data is first written to a buffer before being written to the disk. If the file is not closed properly, the buffer may not be flushed, which means that the data may not be completely written to the disk. Closing the file ensures that the buffer is flushed, ensuring data integrity.\n",

This can happen because the file was not completely written to the disk, or because the file was not properly closed. Closing the file ensures that the file is properly written to the disk, reducing the risk of file corruption."
